# geojson-random-markerbot
Soon to-be* really basic means of getting a bunch of GeoJSON points in a particular area for templating, testing and other quick and dirty purposes


For now:
1) Click "generate" button
2) Enter # of desired GeoJSON points
3) Click through remaining prompts (title opt. not yet implemented)
4) Draw a polygon on the map
5) Magic happens
6) Random points plotted within user drawn polygon

To do:
-Styling and improve UI (get rid of prompts)
*-Means for copying or otherwise obtaining points
-Marker options (title, id, size, color, combine batches/collections from different polygons)
-Alternate means of submitting polygon
-Refactor (in general)
-Consider randomizing options/alternatives to Math.random()
